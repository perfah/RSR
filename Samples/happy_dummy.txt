It looks so good, I might as well not stop. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll.

And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let all these things just sort of happen. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Happy painting, God bless.

Let's have a happy little tree in here. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. We can fix anything. In your world you have total and absolute power.

Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. I like to beat the brush. Anything you want to do you can do here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.
